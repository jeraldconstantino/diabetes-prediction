## Acknowledgement
I would like to extend my greatest gratitude to Engr. Helcy Alon for providing her valuable insight and expertise on the fundamentals of exploratory data analysis and machine learning modeling. I also thank and acknowledge Islam et al. (2020) for gathering diabetes dataset and made it publicly [available](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/early-diabetes-classification) in Kaggle.
